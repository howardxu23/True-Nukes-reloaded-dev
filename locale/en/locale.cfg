californium=This element is highly radioactive. It has a critical mass of only 5kg, and this can be lowered further using neutron reflectors. These properties make it a great way of producing small nuclear weapons, while still achieving a detonation.

fire-shield-equipment=This device provides minimal shielding, but can prevent the thing it is attached to from being set on fire by nuclear weapons or thermobaric devices, although it uses a lot of power to do so. (This does not prevent any other form of fire damage, or being set on fire by other means)

[technology-description]
californium-processing=The low critical mass of Californium allows incredibly small nuclear weapons, allowing them to be used in many more situations.
tritium-processing=A radioactive isotope of hydrogen, only obtainable through the high radiation enviroment inside a nuclear reactor. Useful for backlights on watches, illumating crosshairs on scopes, and making fusion weapons. 

basic-atomic-weapons=A first attempt at forcing fissile material above its critical mass - the core is unwieldy and barely detonates, but the results are nonetheless impressive.
atomic-bomb=Refining the process allows a range of yields from more compact cores, allowing the creation of usable weapons. 

expanded-atomics=Using more fissile material and careful timing, a far more devastating detonation can be created.  
full-fission-atomics=Research and experience allows far more complete detonation of the material, allowing the creation of much larger warheads.   
artillery-atomics=Making a warhead survive the stresses of firing from an artillery cannon is especially challenging, but allows more convenient deployment of the weapons.

californium-weapons=The use of californium allows a wide range of special small nuclear warheads, allowing a wide range of dangerous weapons.
compact-californium-weapons=The use of neutron reflectors reduces the critical mass of the fissile material, allowing even more ill-advised weapon choices.

compact-full-fission-weapons=Using neutron reflectors and californium in larger weapons allows the creation of larger weapons, and worse ways of deploying existing ones.

fusion-weapons=Using the massive energies from a nuclear detonation, tritium can be made to fuse, with apocalyptic results. For those times when just killing everything on [font=default-bold]half[/font] the map isn't enough.\nBring a fast escape train.
compact-fusion-weapons=Making the fusion cores smaller reduces their potential, but allows them to be used in more diverse circumstances - many of which are suicidal.

dense-neutron-flux=Using neutron reflectors allow the creation of exotic elements given far shorter exposures. 

thermobaric-weaponry=These weapons use a high level of fuel relative to their oxidizer, resulting in a large blast wave, as the fuel reacts with the air. They don't do much damage, but do it over a wide area. They are not much good against single strong targets, but are great at killing swarms of weaker enemies. They also light lots of fires, so create lots of pollution.

nuke-random-fires=With this setting enabled, nuclear weapons create lots of small, short lived fires, which can cause lag issues, but create a nice scorched effect.
nuke-crater-noise=With this setting enabled some noise is produced at the edge of the larger craters to make them seem more natural.
destroy-resources-in-crater=This setting can be used to make sure that resources aren't destroyed by nuclear weapons at all. No guarentees are made about this looking natural with tile transitions

retain-death-statistics=May cause performance losses for larger nukes due to huge amount of biter death particle effects. (has no effect for 100kt+)

retain-death-statistics-small=Only applies for nukes < 1kt, may still cause performance problems
retain-death-statistics-for-trees-small=Only applies for nukes < 1kt, may still cause performance problems

large-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the large nukes are so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)
huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the larger nukes are so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)
really-huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the 100kt nuke is so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires) This is very important for the 100kt, and can prevent the game crashing from running out of memory.

general-nuke-range-scaledown=Since all nukes can have large performance impacts, and can do tiny damage across a huge area, this setting reduces the area of effect on weapons. Note that the other scaledowns are applied on top of this one. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)
large-nuke-range-scaledown=Since the large nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast and thermal damage. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)
huge-nuke-range-scaledown=Since the 15kt nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast and thermal damage. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)
really-huge-nuke-range-scaledown=Since the 100kt nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast and thermal damage. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas.

small-boom-material=What material should be used for low yield weapons?\nSame as medium-large - same material will be used as is used for larger weapons - usually Uranium-235\nTrue Nukes Default - uses Californium-251\nMod dependant - uses whatever other installed mods would put in this place, and defaults to the True Nukes varient\nCustom - uses whatever is in the box below.

TN-mushroom-cloud-style-nuclear-flash=If enabled, nuclear explosions will cause a bright flash in their vincinity.\n\nEPILEPSY WARNING:\nSome persons may experience epileptic seizures if they are exposed to certain light frequencies, flickering lights or geometric forms/patterns. In this case I strongly recommend to disable this option! 




optimise-100kt=Always used for nukes >=1Mt. This causes damage to only be applied when a chunk loads. This may break many other mods, but is a lot quicker, uses less memory, and allows bigger nukes. It still has to proccess any already-generated chunks, so detonating bigger nukes in factories is still slow.

enable-fire-shield=This enables the fire shield equiptment. The equiptment is unrealistic and is only there to facilitate the use of modded vehicles which may otherwise burn to death a little too easily.

actually-generate-crater=Disabling this removes the crater entirely - this is only here to remove issues around destroying resources, although it presents a very substantial performance improvement.
